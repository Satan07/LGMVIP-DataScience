TASK 1 : Iris flower Classification

Here we are given a dataset of the measurements of petals and sepals of the Iris Flowere Species. The dataset contain intotal 3 species. Using this dataset we have to train the model to predict the Species for the given data. I have used the K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm to train and test the model. By using KNN algorithm I have succesfully predicted the species with an accuracy of 96.66%.
